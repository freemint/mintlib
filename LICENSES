There is no global copyright on the MiNTlib.  Because the code was
contributed independently by many people, or was borrowed from various
sources, each source file in the library may have its own specific
licence.  Read the source file if you are unsure of the legal status
of a particular library component.  In addition, without any prejudice
to the distribution terms of individual components of the library, you
are reminded that, as a whole, this library, a compilation of free
software, comes to you without any warranty of any sort, explicit or
implied.  The library's maintainers and contributors, past and
present, shall not be held responsible for any kind of damage, direct
or indirect, physical or otherwise, that may have resulted from use or
misuse of any part or combination of parts of this library in any
context whatsoever.  Use of this library implies that you agree with
the above terms and assume all the risks associated with its use.

The library is being constantly developped, particular files are
modified or replaced with new versions.  Hence, it is impossible 
to give a statement which particular functions of the library are
available under which licensing condition.  If you think you are
able to isolate certain parts of the library which are available
under conditions that you are not willing to meet it is your task
to check the license notes in the individual source files.  

Under normal circumstances, use of any library function or header
file will at least during the link process drag so many libc modules
into your link that you have to meet all license conditions listed
hereafter.

The individual terms are:

o The COPYMINT license, the "main" license of this library:
